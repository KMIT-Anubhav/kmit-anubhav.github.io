Have you ever enjoyed doing something so much that you NEVER feel the amount of time you invest in it as hard work ? This is called passion. The “something” might be a sport, playing an instrument, learning a subject that you love or anything. Unfortunately many of us in India don’t have the luxury to follow our passion. Instead we are pressured to be a doctor, an engineer or some line of work that involves a lot of money.

Albert Einstein once said - “You can’t judge a fish by its ability to climb trees.” Unfortunately that’s exactly what is happening in our society. From a very young age, Children are forced to do things they don’t like. They are scolded for getting bad marks in math, but are they ever asked if they love math ? Maybe they could be an amazing singer if allowed or an amazing sports person. What would you think would happen if director rajamouli was forced to become a doctor when he was a kid. Would we make those amazing movies? People do amazing things when they do what they love. Albert Einstein wasn't a scientist because his parents told him to be so. He did it because he loved Physics. That is why he spent years on the most difficult problems in Physics and produced the most beautiful Theories. Instead of producing passionate people who help society, we end up producing uninterested people who just do things for the sake of marks and money.

In the end what I wanna say is society would progress most if people are allowed to follow their passion and not just run after money. Because if you perfect yourself at what you love, the money and fame would automatically come after you. You contribute and earn the most when you do work for the sake of work rather than do it for the sake of money.

How many of you chose Computer Science because you love it and how many of you have been a victim of parental pressures?
