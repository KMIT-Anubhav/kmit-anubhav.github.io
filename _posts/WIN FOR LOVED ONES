NO MATTER HOW HORRIBLE THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU FACE DO NOT GET DISTURBED NOR BE AFRAID

   Let your heart bleed tons of misery,
Let them, who you feel are yours,betray you,
 Even if your tears flow like streams,
 Even if empty pockets taunt you,
 And all that you do right be wronged,
When you face the question,"Should I live or die?"
   To be or not to be, so to say,
Let there be spokes in the wheel of your progress,
Even if insults and censure be showered on you,
 Even if your debtors do torment you,
Let the court cases subject you to anxiety,and
The creeper of jasmine you planted turns
    out to be a harmful reptile,
  And tries to bite you, and no one
     understands you,
Even when you starve with no food whatsoever,
Do not be afraid nor be disturbed,for,

YOU can break,for sure, the vicious cycle of problems...

DO NOT FEEL DISHEARTNED OR HUMILIATED , Always have trust in your self and trust in the people who TRUST you and be HARD WORKING , SUCCESS AUTOMATICALLY KNOCKS YOUR DOOR!!!!.

ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR UPCOMING and AMAZING FUTURE..

THANK YOU....
